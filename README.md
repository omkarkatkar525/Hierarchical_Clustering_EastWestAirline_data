# Clustering
There are Three types of Regressions.

1.Hierarchical Clustering

2.K-Means Clustering

3.Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)

## Hierarchical Clustering:
```sh
When input variables and output variable is having linear relationship we can use this Regression model. 
This correlation between input and output variables can be positive or negative.
When there are more then one independent variables and one dependent variable then that is Multi-Linear regression. 
Both input variables and output variable should be continuous.  
```

## Data Used :
```sh
EastWestAirlines: Airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters.
```  
## Programming:
```sh
Python
```
